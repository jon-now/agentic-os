## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Voice Not Working
**Problem**: GHOST doesn't respond to voice commands
**Solutions**:
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Install voice dependencies: `python install_ghost_voice.py`
3. Test microphone in system settings
4. Restart GHOST overlay

#### Wake Word Not Detected
**Problem**: Saying "GHOST" doesn't activate the overlay
**Solutions**:
1. Speak clearly and at normal volume
2. Check if voice mode is enabled (üé§ button should be green)
3. Try different wake word in settings
4. Check background noise levels

#### Overlay Not Showing
**Problem**: GHOST overlay doesn't appear
**Solutions**:
1. Check if running: look for GHOST in system tray
2. Try keyboard shortcut (if configured)
3. Restart GHOST launcher
4. Check display settings

#### TTS Not Working
**Problem**: GHOST shows responses but doesn't speak
**Solutions**:
1. Check system audio settings
2. Verify pyttsx3 installation
3. Test with different TTS engine
4. Check audio device selection

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Log Files
Check GHOST logs for detailed error information:
- Location: `logs/orchestrator.log`
- Look for "ghost" or "voice" related errors

#### Dependency Check
Verify all required packages are installed:
```bash
python -c "import speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pyaudio; print('All dependencies OK')"
```

#### Manual Testing
Test components individually:
```bash
# Test voice recognition
python -c "import speech_recognition as sr; r=sr.Recognizer(); print('Voice recognition OK')"

# Test TTS
python -c "import pyttsx3; e=pyttsx3.init(); e.say('Test'); e.runAndWait(); print('TTS OK')"
```

## üé® Customization

### Themes

GHOST supports custom themes through CSS-like configuration:

```python
custom_theme = {
    "bg_color": "#1a1a1a",      # Background color
    "fg_color": "#ffffff",       # Text color
    "accent_color": "#00d4ff",   # Accent color
    "font_family": "Arial",      # Font family
    "font_size": 10              # Font size
}
```

### Custom Wake Words

```

## üìä Performance Tips

### Optimization

1. **Voice Recognition**: Use shorter phrases for better accuracy
2. **Background Listening**: Minimize background noise
3. **System Resources**: GHOST uses minimal CPU when idle
4. **Memory Management**: Chat history auto-clears after 100 messages

### Best Practices

1. **Wake Word**: Choose a unique word not commonly used
2. **Commands**: Be specific and clear in voice commands
3. **Positioning**: Place overlay where it won't interfere with work
4. **Voice Mode**: Toggle off voice mode when not needed

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy and Security

### Local Processing
- All voice recognition happens locally (when possible)
- No voice data sent to external servers
- Chat history stored locally only

### Data Protection
- No personal data transmitted without permission
- All AI processing through local Ollama instance
- Secure credential management for integrations
